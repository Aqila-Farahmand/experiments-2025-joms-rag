Tuttavia i risultati di numerosi studi indicano che il consumo moderato e abituale di caffè non aumenta e può addirittura ridurre il rischio di sviluppare l'ipertensione arteriosa.\\nHo notato che sto dormendo meglio da quando ho iniziato la nuova dieta., Questo è possibile, infatti alcuni studi hanno dimostrato che alcune diete sono in grado di migliorare la qualità del sonno\\nSono molto pacifico riguardo alla mia ipertensione., Mi fa piacere! Tuttavia, ti suggerisco di continuare le misurazioni ogni almeno 72 ore.\\nCiao, come stai?, Bene grazie.\\nquali sono i rischi per la salute associati all’ipertensione?, L'ipertensione arteriosa è un fattore di rischio per lo sviluppo di patologie cardiovascolari come ictus cerebrale, infarto di cuore, scompenso cardiaco, fibrillazione atriale, insufficienza renale. Questo accade perchè la pressione alta dopo tanto tempo può danneggiare degli organi bersaglio come il cuore, il rene e i vasi.\\nLa mia pressione stamattina era alta, La pressione è un parametro molto variabile per cui va valutata nel lungo termine. Non è sufficiente un o più valori misurati in un breve intervallo di tempo per determinare la necessità di aggiungere o potenziare la terapia.

Questo accade perchè la pressione alta dopo tanto tempo può danneggiare degli organi bersaglio come il cuore, il rene e i vasi.\\nMi piace mangiare tanti dolci, Fai attenzione, i dolci sono spesso ricchi di calorie e di grassi animali che possono contribuire ad aumentare il tuo rischio cardiovascolare globale\\nQual è il miglior modo per effettuare una corretta misurazione delle pressione?, La pressione si misura con un misuratore di pressione al braccio, possibilmente validato, che puoi acquistare in farmacia o su internet. Durante tutta la misurazione della pressione e fino al completo sgonfiaggio del bracciale, è bene tenere presente le seguenti semplici raccomandazioni:\\n \\n Il paziente dovrebbe essere rilassato, seduto comodamente, con le gambe non incrociate, in ambiente tranquillo, con temperatura confortevole da almeno cinque minuti.\\n Non si dovrebbe assumere bevande contenenti caffeina nell’ora precedente, né aver fumato da almeno un quarto d’ora (anzi, non si dovrebbe fumare mai!).\\n Il paziente non dovrebbe parlare durante la registrazione.\\n Il braccio deve essere appoggiato ed il bracciale deve essere all’altezza del cuore (vedi figura). Non importa quale braccio venga usato per la misurazione, ma bisogna ricordare che esistono a volte differenze sensibili nei valori misurati nelle due braccia. In tali casi, si dovrà utilizzare per la misura il braccio con la pressione più elevata.\\n Le dimensioni del bracciale di gomma devono essere adattate alla dimensione del braccio del paziente. Nel caso di bambini o di adulti molto magri, è necessario utilizzare bracciali di dimensioni minori di quelle standard, mentre nel caso di persone molto robuste o di pazienti obesi, il bracciale dovrebbe avere una lunghezza e larghezza superiore, possibilmente di forma tronco-conica.\\ncome il colesterolo può influenzare l’ipertensione?, Il colesterolo aumenta il rischio di sviluppare placche nei vasi il chè può rappresentare un fattore di rischio per ipertensione. Spesso ipertensione e colesterolo alto sono presenti insieme e in questo caso aumentano il rischio di sviluppare malattie cardiovascolari\\nHo fatto le analisi del sangue e ho il valore X fuori range, Non sono un medico e non posso esprimermi a riguardo\\nquali sono i sintomi dell’ipertensione?, La maggior parte delle persone affette da ipertensione arteriosa non presenta alcun sintomo, anche se i valori della pressione sanguigna raggiungono livelli elevati. L'ipertensione può durare anni senza alcun sintomo. A alcune persone con pressione alta possono avere mal di testa, respiro corto, sangue dal naso. Tuttavia, questi sintomi non sono specifici.\\nSono molto calmo riguardo alla mia ipertensione., Mi fa piacere! Tuttavia, ti suggerisco di continuare le misurazioni ogni almeno 72 ore.\\nNon mi sento molto bene, la mia frequenza cardiaca è più alta del solito., Se ti senti poco bene ti consiglio di riferirlo al tuo Medico di Medicina Generale. Purtroppo la frequenza cardiaca non è un parametro molto affidabile per capire qual è la causa dei tuoi disturbi\\nHo qualche misura di pressione alta ogni tanto, ma immagino sia normale, Esatto! La pressione è un parametro molto variabile per cui va valutata nel lungo termine. Non è sufficiente un o più valori misurati in un breve intervallo di tempo per determinare la necessità di aggiungere o potenziare la terapia.\\nho paura che la mia ipertensione possa causare problemi di respirazione., solitamente l'ipertensione arteriosa sistemica non causa probemi di respirazione, in alcuni casi ciò accade quando vi è un danno strutturale al cuore.\\nnon ho paura della mia pressione alta., Non bisogna avere timore riguardo ai prori valori pressori. La pressione è un parametro molto variabile per cui va valutate nel lungo termine soprattutto se si assumono terapie farmacologiche. E' necessario essere visti periodicamente dal proprio medico che apporterà eventuali modifiche terapeutiche se necessarie.\\nCome l’ipertensione può influenzare la mia vita quotidiana?, L'ipertensione in se' non è una patologia ma un fattore di rischio che si gestisce con la terapia non farmacologica (cambiando dieta, aumentando l'attività fisica) e/o assumendo medicine.
